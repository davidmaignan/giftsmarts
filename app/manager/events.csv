123138154739307}Exhibition Opening: Simon Hughes}Division Gallery is proud to present Winnipeg-based artist Simon Hughes’ second solo exhibition with the gallery.      Simon Hughes’ paintings spiritedly retool geometric and hard edge abstraction. Hughes layers colours with a meticulous masking process, working through addition rather than reduction. With a hand as stringent as it is playful, the artist explores the role figuration played in mid-century abstraction, paying particular attention to landscape painting as well as design and advertising in this context. In Cold Theory, a recessive arrangement of blue quadrilaterals is a wink to Josef Albers’ Homage to a Square. If Albers sought purity of form and experience of colour, then Hughes underscores our inability to halt form and color from reaching association, with the gradient blues suggesting gelid temperature and self-reflexively pointing to the artist’s signature banded glaciers.       For this latest exhibition, Hughes focuses on the recessive and expansive quality of his paintings. Studio scenes depict windows framing Canadian vistas, landscapes are displayed as wall hangings that cascade like tessellations—insular framing allows the wilderness to find refuge within the domestic, and paintings to display paintings of their own. And while referentiality continuously folds onto itself, Hughes’ also adds references that act like hints, pointing the viewer away and outwards. Though Seaman’s Quarters includes a porthole with a view of Hughes’ recognizable arctic peak, it displays alongside it a tribal mask, the sort appropriated by the cubists to invent their fragmented plains, a style exultantly taken up by Hughes.      Finally, these pictorial works are complimented by Hughes’ new time-lapse video, Homage to Charles Schulz. The video sees keys on a toy baby grand piano played by languidly melting icicles. Concerning himself with the intersection where high-brow and popular culture meet, Hughes nostalgically turns to a revelatory moment in the Peanuts where Charles Schulz's text was replaced with virtuosic musical notation appearing over Schroeder hunched at his piano. The crossing of hierarchies is here imagined as stage for new forms of theatricality beyond category.      http://www.galeriedivision.com/toronto/artist/simon-hughes/exhibition/-20}2016-02-13 14:00:00.0}115772685476890

SKRILLEX   https://www.facebook.com/skrillex   http://soundcloud.com/skrillex   http://www.skrillex.com/   http://twitter.com/skrillex      Some get hung up on the apparent ease and freedom of it all. Bewildered that someone can galvanise and ignite multiple genres of music with songs entirely written, recorded and mixed on a single laptop loaded with software and synths available to absolutely anyone with a credit card and internet connection.      But for Sonny Moore, someone you may know better as Skrillex, none of this troubles him greatly. The 24-year-old electronic imagineer focuses on little more than the story of community, creativity and commitment that has taken him from warehouse parties in Los Angeles to a defining role in the modern zeitgeist.      It started to go well for Sonny when he filtered out the noise and distraction of his world as a solo artist and started mining the ephemeral moments he had been sharing with friends in clubs and parties across the city he calls home since his mid-teen years. The restless, urgent and kaleidoscopic sounds of EDM and bass music had spoken to him for the best part of a decade, one day he just started talking back.

322169334564470}I'm Shmacked X New York City}There is an old english saying “Good things come to those who wait.”      Before I begin, please like Omicon Entertainment, we will be giving out free tickets every week.      So here it is I’m Shmacked is back for the absolute biggest and only show this summer. (WITH HUGE ARTISTS ON THE BILL)      I know what you guys are thinking. “This is just going to be another party where I get drunk and wake up telling myself that I’m never going to drink again”       Well, you’re wrong again.      Not are we only coming back for the biggest show this summer but we are coming back with FULL 3D productions. And on top of that we will have it as a space themed show where you will feel like you’re on a different planet.       Yes there will be 3D holograms (no there won’t be a Tupac hologram) but an experience like you have never experienced before. Yes things flying at you. While you rage. A trippy experience.      This is going to the party that you actually forget that you are at a party. Standing there, without the slightest doubt, convinced you’re someplace else. Going, in the space of minutes, to a place that’s frightening, intense, heart-rending, altogether magical – a place you’ve never been before.      This show will grab your senses. Visually, there is no frame. The images will be bigger, higher, wider than your field of view. You’re no longer at the window peeking out; you’re outside among the stars. And that sensation is intensified by the sound. It’s all around you and it’s real – so much so that the whole experience is visceral. You don’t just hear and see at this show. You will feel it in your bones.      When you miss I’m Shmacked, you’ll get depressed.   When you get depressed, you will begin to sleep a lot.   When you sleep a lot, you will get fat.   When you get fat, you start running the treadmill.   When you start running on the treadmill, you fall and break your neck.   When you fall and break your neck, you become a vegetable.      Don’t become a vegetable. Don’t miss I’m Shmacked.      Last but not least, we are giving away a trip to Miami and Ultra to one of our lucky attendees. Thank us later.      If you want to be a brand ambassador for I’m Shmacked and represent your college email us at kazi@vanitytour.com      Brand Ambassadors get paid, get into the shows free, get free VIP, unlimited drinks and featured at the end of the video.

The genre has made instant stars out of producers like Baauer and RL Grime, and other producers are hopping on the bandwagon as the genre begins to grow and grow.       In response to this recent development, New York City finally has it’s first party dedicated to the genre – Grimey at The Gramercy Theater. The first ‘Grimey’ party was such a rousing success, that the producers are bringing it back again, this time on Saturday, February 2nd. This event’s line-up is stacked with up and coming talent, highlighting M|O|D featuring C.Z., Lil Texas, Arnold, and REWROTE.      You can expect this party to keep your head bouncing and your ass shaking all night long. When the trap starts bumping, the bass never stops, and these parties can get out of control. Whether you like dance music, hip hop, or the perfect blend of both, The Gramercy Theater is the place to be on Saturday, February 2. Check out some tracks by the artists on the bill to get a taste of what’s to come.
